                <h3>Acrylic Painting</h3>
                <h4>
                    Paint-Based
                    <span class="level">Beginner</span>
                </h4>
                <p>Acrylic painting is one of the simplest and most accessable form of painting. It is a great choice to get started in art. Anyone, regardless of age, would be able to grasp the concepts of acrylic painting with much ease.</p>

                <h3>Watercolor Painting</h3>
                <h4>
                    Paint-Based
                    <span class="level">Beginner</span>
                </h4>
                <p>Watercolor painting utilizes paints that can still be usable even when it has dried. Artists of this medium can use it both fresh from the tube or even the dried-version. Either way, it adds a softness to their paintings and is spontaneous when on canvas. </p>

                <h3>Sculpting</h3>
                <h4>
                    Material-Based
                    <span class="level">Intermediate</span>
                </h4>
                <p>Art can come in all forms, including that of sculpting. Unlike painting, the canvas is usually a clump of clay, a chunk of stone, or even some wood bark, and many more materials. Works of this medium usually last for a long time as it is easier to care for compared to a painting.</p>

                <h3>Oil Painting</h3>
                <h4>

                    <span class="level">Intermediate</span>
                </h4>
                <p>Oil painting uses paints with drying oils as a binder. It is actually on the more expensive side and is a little difficult to learn, especially for beginners. However, once you have honed in your skill, you would be able to produce beautiful works of art worth the price.</p>
